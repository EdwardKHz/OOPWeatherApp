# Weather App â€“ Final Project for OOP Course

This repository contains my final project for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course** at USEK. The project is a desktop weather application developed using **JavaFX, Spring Boot, and MySQL**.

## Overview

The Weather App allows users to fetch and view real-time weather data for a given location using the OpenWeather API. The application also stores some data locally in a MySQL database.

## Important Note

As required by the course, **most of the code is implemented in the `WeatherApp.java` file**, which serves as the main entry point of the application. Because of this constraint, the traditional **MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture is not strictly enforced**. While MVC principles are considered, you will notice that the project structure prioritizes the course requirements over strict design patterns.

## Features

- Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeather API.
- Displays weather information in a JavaFX GUI.
- Stores selected weather data in a MySQL database.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Java, JavaFX, Spring Boot  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **APIs:** OpenWeather API
